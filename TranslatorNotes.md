Hello to all translators,

first of all thanks for your overwhelmingly interest in translating the survival manual! I am writing this as I got a lot of requests and mails regarding the state of translations. From a distance it sounds really easy - and for normal apps it sometimes is - but there are some special problems regarding translation with this app:

* There is text in images - I need to find a way to separate images and text for easier translation.
* Currently imperial measuring units ( like miles ) are used - Ideally this should also be translation vector.
* I imagine changes in the source language - there needs to be a way to keep them in sync ( especially for lists )
* Having a lot of languages makes the app bigger ( especially if there is a lot of text ) - there need to be a way to deal with this ( e.g. a language-apk split - or downloadable packs ) - I do not want to waste space for a lot of languages I will never read
* ..

These are the reasons I cannot just put the stuff in a translation management interface like transifex and give a go for translators which I would do usually do. If you see solutions to these problems please let me know. At some point I will give a go for translations - but I want to have a system where I have a way to deal with the problems I see - or at least see a way to deal with them in the future and having a way to keep translations in sync.
