> This section will give you some information regarding this application. But **if you are in a survival situation right now** - please **skip this** blurb and directly jump to the section that contains the information for your current top most problem/need.

This app is intended to guide you in rough times but can also be used for having fun outdoors and teach you things. And the fun part can even be used to train important skills for potential survival situations. Reading is only one part - practice and understanding are also really important.
The app is based on the FM 3-05.70 Field Manual - but now [it is a wiki](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki) ( like in wikipedia ) so the content is able to be improved easily. That said - when you see something that can be improved - or if you find something is missing - step up and join the content-team.
Also if you are able to illustrate. I am currently adding new sections and am not able to illustrate. E.g. the new section on [Power](Power) could use some images of e.g. wind and water generators. It is important to keep the images small - Ideally they are vector images - but black&white images as the other ones in this app also work. The file-sizes must be small so people do not uninstall their Survival-App to make space ( also temporary and then forget about it ). This app should always be one-digit MegaBytes in size so people can just keep it on their phones without really worrying about it.
There will be updates to content and the app - please join the BetaTesters to give feedback and get the newest stuff first.
This app uses:

* the android-support-libraries for compatibility and design
* [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) as language ( Big up to JetBrains - love this language <3 - so much fun )
* [KotPref](https://github.com/chibatching/Kotpref) for storing preferences
* [TxtMark](https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark) for markdown
* [TouchImageView](https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView) for making images touchable/zoomable
* [SnackEngage](https://github.com/ligi/SnackEngage) for giving you some snacks

This app is free and libre software under GPLv3. You can find the source-code [on github](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual) - Pull-Requests are very welcome! Just before doing big changes please contact me so that there is no work in vain.

As a lot of people ask: translations are planned but really difficult. You can read about this [here](TranslatorNotes). That said I will start with partial translation support ( some sections and in app translations ) soon and there are already a lot of translators standing by already ( thanks a lot for this ). But first the current content has to be improved more. It would be great help if people could break up the images with lists into markdown which is easier to translate and needs less space.

That said happy surviving - with the hope you never get in such trouble that you really need this guide but had fun preparing for potential situations and learned something.

Live long and prosper!
