## Methods to generate power
 
### Solar

There are [Solar USB chargers](SolarUSBCharger). Harvesting the power of the sun is a great and very clean way to generate power. There are only 2 real drawbacks for this kind of power:

* it is not available at night 
* the output depends on the weather

But if it is available you can use it very effortless. While the sun is working for you - you can do other useful things like getting some food or building a shelter.

### Bicycle

In contrast to the sun - generating power with your Bicycle is more effort - but it can also be a lot of fun and a good exercise. And it might be very available as most bikes already have a "generator" installed. Usually this "generator" / dynamo is there to power your lights on the bike. But it can also charge a phone. You only need a converter to 5V/USB - you can build them yourself or buy one. But be careful here - there are some really bad converters out there. I would recommend building one yourself.

### Wind

Wind-power is also great. It can be available day and night - but you need wind. Also it is often more bulky and hard to transport. But it can be a great option if you are stationary and not on the move. It is not that difficult to build a wind-generator. Basically you just need to get the wind to turn something - use junk and your MultiTool to get the wind to rotate a shaft and attach a motor. A motor is basically the same as a generator - then you just need to build some electronics to harvest the power.

### Water

You can also use water to generate power. One option is to use the flow of a river passing by. There you basically do the same as you would with the wind-turbine - just that water and not wind turns the generator. One big advantage of using a river is that you get a steady rotation-speed and the flow usually does not stop as wind can do. But it depends on having access to a river or a dam. Speaking of a dam - you can also build things to direct the water and make the flow faster.

### Heat-Difference

You can also generate power by heat-difference. E.g. with a fire. There are now turnkey ready solutions like the [BioLite Wood Burning Campstove with USB](CampStoveUSB) or there are also some pots out there with a power USB outlet. Science and Engineering brought us some really cool and mobile new options here just recently. You could also harvest the power of a fire via steam as is often done in a large scale today. But for small scale this is really effortful to use and implement.

### Hand Crank

Using the muscles of your arm is another option. There are small USB cranks to operate by hand some even [with a light](HandCrankUSB). But be aware that this really binds you to the task as you cannot really do much while turning the crank. Also I personally find it a really exhausting and boring task - I prefer to use the bicycle. But it is always good to have a lot of options and I own a small crank for emergencies.

### Car

You can also use a car to generate power. A car always comes with a generator - if you drive around the ( typically 12V ) battery is charged. You just have to convert the 12V to 5V for the phone. You can really easily build this yourself cheaply e.g. with a LM7805 Voltage Regulator IC or you buy some [car usb-charger](CarUSBCharger). But be aware that you hurt the environment when doing so. This should be the last resort or used when you drive around in a car anyway to get from point A to point B.

## Tips & Tricks

### Power-Bank

Get a good power-bank. Often you do not want to directly use the energy when generating. Lets take solar - this way you can compensate for solar not working at night. You charge your power-bank at day and can use the power at night. Be aware that the capacity information on these power-banks are often straight lies. Try them out for yourself and measure!

### Stay DC

If possible stay DC ( Direct Current ) - if you need to make a DC/AC ( Alternating Current ) AC/DC roundtrip ( e.g. with some inverter ) you loose a lot of power ( in fact you never loose power - but here you convert it in the form of heat which is often not the form you need ). Also DC is most of the time less deadly in handling - so it helps you to survive the process of surviving ;-)

### Save Power

The power you save you do not have to generate. A big help in saving power is measuring what device consumes how much energy in which state.
